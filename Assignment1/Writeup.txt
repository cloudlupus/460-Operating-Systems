HOW TO RUN
    run the runme.sh
    it should make and then run the scheduler saving textfiles
    to manually run it type ./SCHEDULER 2 for ULE
    and ./SCHEDULER 16 for 4BSD

1) ULE
    Pattern with time slices:
    overall run time of the program appears to get longer as the timeslice is increased.
    the scheduler overheads increase up until a a level off.
    the average time waiting on an IO increases as the time slices become longer. This is due to the fact that CPU heavy processes aren't forced to give up the CPU
    average queue times increase as time slice increases
    

2) BSD
    pattern with time slices:
    Scheduler overheads decreased to a point as the timeslice increases in size. EG 50ms time slice had 1425ms of overhead, 100ms timelsice had 1375, and 200ms timeslice had 1203, however 1000 ms had a 1338 ms overhead. It appears to get to a stable point.
    
    the longer the time slice the longer the program appears to run overall.
    
    average time waiting for an IO appears to stay consistently about half of the timeslice time.
    
    as the timeslice increased average queue wait times increased. 
    the responsiveness was about hte same or better than that of ULE.
    
KNOWN ISSUES:
    sometimes a process may wait on IO but never end up being dispatched from IO even have never had any ohter IO happen. In which case it reports a 0 avg, 0 max and a long_max min. this information doesn't factor into any ohter stats it's just bad information due to termination of the program before redispatching a process.
